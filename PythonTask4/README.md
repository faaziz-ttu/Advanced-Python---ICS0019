#task.py contains web crawling and web scraping with scrapy library
#task2.py contains web crawling and web scraping with bs4 (beautifulsoup4) library

I used "http://books.toscrape.com/" webpage for scraping. 

 I tried to get "title", "price", "availability", "IMG" source of books using scrapy and bs4. 

 I used "scrapy shell crawler -o output_scrapy.json" command in terminal to save output in output_scrapy.json file

 scrapy works faster than bs4.
