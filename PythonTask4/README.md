#task.py contains web crawling and web scraping with scrapy library
#task2.py contains web crawling and web scraping with bs4 (beautifulsoup4) library

#I used "http://books.toscrape.com/" webpage for scraping. 

# I tried to get image "title", "price", "availability", "IMG" source. 

# I used "scrapy shell crawler -o output_scrapy.json" command in terminal to save output in output_scrapy.json file

# scrapy works faster than bs4.
